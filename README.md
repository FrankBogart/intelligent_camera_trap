The Intelligent Camera Trap is an autonomous wildlife video recording system designed to capture behavioral-ecology
grade footage of animals with minimal human interference. The system uses computer vision to localize and track nearby
animals with its camera turret. To use power only when necessary, the system uses a cascaded detection and wake-up scheme.
